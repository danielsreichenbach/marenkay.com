Simple ReMarkable blog system
=============================
[ReMarkable!][1] is a set of text conventions for writing article content
in plain text that is translated into the corresponding HTML by the
ReMarkable script.

This blog system leverages *ReMarkable* to convert ReMarkably-formatted
text into pretty, semantic HTML5 with support for different media devices

You can edit your content in any text editor you prefer, and simply deploy
your site using the include Capistrano recipe.
