Simple ReMarkable blog system
=============================
[ReMarkable!](http://camendesign.com/code/remarkable) is a set of text
conventions for writing article content in plain text that is translated
into the corresponding HTML by the ReMarkable script.

This blog system leverages *ReMarkable* to convert ReMarkably-formatted
text into pretty, semantic HTML5 with support for different media devices

You can edit your content in any text editor you prefer, and simply deploy
your site using the include Capistrano recipe.
