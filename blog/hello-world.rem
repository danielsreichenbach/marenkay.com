# Hello, world! #

Here we are, or better said: _here I am_.  Keeping a blog where I talk about
things that matter to me as a person, and as a developer has always been way
too much for me.  While I like working and developing code a lot, I sincerely
dislike _bragging_ about it, or even showing it off.

But times change, and so do human beings.  It's not like I want to brag about
my development achievements but rather get them off my mind, and release stuff
so that others my leverage my work.

## WTF?! ## (#hello-wtf)

fig.	<"Seriously?" /&__HREF__;/wtf.png>

	: Maximum WTF level reached.

Seriously! What is this thing here? It certainly is not <WordPress (//wordpress.org)>
or any other blogging software to begin with.  Ever since I came accross the
blog of <Kroc Camen (//camendesign.com)> and learned more about his Markdown
like syntax <ReMarkable (//camendesign.com/code/remarkable)> I wanted to give
it a shot, since the idea of focussing on just publishing content without
loosing focus because of the added overhead of a blogging software on top.

Kroc kindly open sourced his blog, and ReMarkable on <github (//github.com/Kroc)>,
and thus I forked both projects <here (//github.com/danielsreichenbach/marenkay.com)>
and <here (//github.com/danielsreichenbach/ReMarkable)> and added my own
flavour on top.

Changes include a deployment recipe for <Capistrano (//github.com/capistrano/capistrano)>,
a custom design, addition of a few default pages, and a changes to page
cache while in development mode.  I also extended ReMarkable to output extra classes
for syntax highlighting with <google code prettify (//code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/)>.

Follwing the spirit of Kroc, you can also see the full source code for this
blog *without any restrictions*!  A template for Capistrano deployment is
included, and you should be able to customize it for your own blog easily.

## Expect... ## (#hello-expect)

There will be code, sillyness, opionionated talks, probably even slides to
go further, and a few bits and pieces about family, raising children, and
travelling around the world to learn more.

I have a strong belief in life being a long journey where one thrives by
increasing knowledge and understanding of life, and humanity.  Though I
do have my doubts about human beings and their state of evolution being
even close to something worthwhile.

Being a nerd, and active in development and system administration ever since
I started working, it's very likely that you will see posts on topics such
as Linux, gcc, clang, Puppet, KVM, etc.  There still is the gamer me, who
surely will rant on, too -- though I'm less of a gamer with my 35 years
than I was with 25.

These days games usually tickle my sense for development, and while playing
a game instead of just playing I tend to analyze how certain aspects of a
game may be built, or probably should not be built.  As such, I started
work on a project I've not so cleverly dubbed _Goblin Workshop_ which deals
with the development of <World of Warcraft (//eu.battle.net/wow)>.

*I am looking forward* to this whole blogging thing, and will try my best to
post useful and amusing things as often as my spare time allows me to.

With kind regards,Â¬
